# FIFA_WorldCup_2018

Analysis of the FIFA World Cup 2018 data in order to find which factors (variables) influence a country to be closer to the first place. 

## Datasets used:

The **Football dataset** required the most cleaning due to column names, country names, invalid signs and extra spaces.
The **Market Value dataset** required to fix/find some missing values and the country names needed follow the same format as the other datasets.
The **Average Temperature dataset** required to convert the temperature to Celcius.
