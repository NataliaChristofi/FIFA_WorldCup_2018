# FIFA_WorldCup_2018

Analysis of the FIFA World Cup 2018 data in order to find which factors (variables) influence a country to be closer to the first place. 

## Datasets used:

The **Football dataset** required the most cleaning due to column names, country names, invalid signs and extra spaces.<br />
The **Market Value dataset** required to fix/find some missing values and the country names needed follow the same format as the other datasets.<br />
The **Average Temperature dataset** required to convert the temperature to Celcius.

*Acknowledgments*: Majority of work done in private jupyter notebook repo in Faculty platform provided by University College London.

# Dependency

- Python 3.8, 3.7
- Jupyter Notebook 

# Usage

``` Cleaning_FootballData.ipynb ``` is a good example of how to clean a dataset in order to be ready to use it and analyse it <br />
``` Maps.ipynb ``` is a useful piece of code to make a map, highly recommended as a visualisation when you have a list of countries <br />
``` Visualizations.ipynb ``` contains different types of visualisation with the cleaned data
